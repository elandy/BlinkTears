# BlinkTears

**Description**

This item was inspired by playing too much Portal and by the Blink attack from the Protoss' Stalkers (Starcraft II)
 Allows you to teleport directly among your enemies, giving you a short invincibility time to damage and escape.
 Great for crowd control. Riskier gameplay but potentially  higher damage. 

**Features**

Adds the Blink tears passive item to pools: Boss, Treasure, Shop and Greed Mode Shop. Its effects are:

    -Player shoots “Blink Tears” every certain amount of normal tears, depending on luck (like Lead Pencil).
    -Blink Tears switch position between player and enemy.
    -At player’s new location, spawns knock-back fart and breaks rocks in small radius.
    -After teleporting, player is invincible for a short while.
    -Shot speed up.
    -Tears down (also the cap).
    -Ability to teleport to entrance in the chance you get stuck (hit key 'R' once).

**Synergies and interactions**

Works with Incubus and other tear shooting familiars.
Works great with orbitals and creep spawning items.
Overridden by lasers, Brimstone and Ludovico Technique.
